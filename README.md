This example demonstrates a common issue in F# related to mutable variables.  In F#, immutability is preferred, but mutable variables can be used. The bug shows how a function call can lead to unexpected behavior if you assume that changing a mutable variable within the function impacts the original variable outside the scope of the function. The solution demonstrates how to use mutable variables correctly to achieve the intended result.  It demonstrates the proper usage of mutable values and when it is appropriate to utilize them over immutable values within the F# programming language.
